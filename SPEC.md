# memlint — Claude Code build prompt (v0.1)
# Usage: run from a fresh empty repo folder. Start in plan mode.

Build a Go CLI called `memlint` — an invariant checker (think fsck, not
ESLint) for file-based agent memory systems: repos of markdown that AI
runtimes (Claude Code, Codex) read as persistent memory/contracts.

Single command: `memlint check [path]` (default "."). Reads .memlint.toml
at the target root. Missing config section = that rule is disabled.

Rules (all read-only; never autofix):
1. [mirrors] pairs=[[a,b],...] — files byte-identical; dirs: same *.md set,
   each pair byte-identical. Violations RED.
2. [append_only] files=[...] — `git show HEAD:<file>` must be a prefix of
   the working copy (trailing-newline tolerant). Violation RED, report first
   divergent line as was/now. No git baseline = YELLOW note.
3. [pointers] files=[...], roots=[...] — extract repo-path-like refs from
   the listed files (backticked or bare, containing "/"). Check existence
   ONLY if first segment is in roots. Skip: URLs (://), placeholders (<...>,
   YYYY), anchors. Dead ref = RED.
4. [junk] globs=[...] — matches anywhere under root (skip .git) = YELLOW.
5. [tokens] watch=[globs], budget=N — len(chars)/4 per file, over = YELLOW.

Output: findings to stdout, ANSI color (red / yellow / green summary),
auto-disable color when stdout is not a TTY; --no-color, --strict (yellow
also fails), --format json. Exit 0 clean-or-yellow, 1 red (or yellow w/
--strict), 2 config/usage error. Quiet on clean: one green line.

Deps: BurntSushi/toml only. stdlib flag, no cobra. golang.org/x/term OK
for TTY detect. Module: github.com/frankbesch/memlint. MIT license.

Tests: table-driven for the pointer extractor (cases MUST include:
"reading/daily" w/ roots not containing "reading" -> skip; "memory/x.md" ->
check; "reviews/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>.html" -> skip; "https://a/b" -> skip) and
for append-only (append=pass, rewrite=fail, truncate=fail). testdata/
fixture-broken with 5 planted defects; fixture-clean.

Acceptance: go test ./... green; check on fixture-broken exits 1 with 5
reds + 2 yellows; on fixture-clean exits 0. README with real usage output,
roadmap section, install via go install.

Non-goals v0.1 (do not build): autofix, HTML output, subcommands, watch
mode, semantic/content linting, config generation.

Start in plan mode: plan + file layout before code.
